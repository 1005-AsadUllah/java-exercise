-> A set of built-in tools in Java for storing and managing data efficiently.
->Introduced in Java 2 (1998) and improved in Java 5 (Generics) and Java 8 (Lambdas & Default Methods).

2. Why Use Collections Instead of Arrays?
   ✅ Dynamic Size – Collections grow/shrink as needed, unlike arrays.
   ✅ Built-in Features – Search, sort, remove duplicates, etc.
   ✅ More Flexible – Different types (List, Set, Map) for different needs.

3. Main Parts of the Collections Framework
   Collection (stores and processes objects)

List (ordered, allows duplicates) → ArrayList, LinkedList
Set (no duplicates) → HashSet, TreeSet
Queue (FIFO, first-in, first-out) → PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque
Map (key-value pairs, like a dictionary) → HashMap, TreeMap, ConcurrentHashMap

Iterator (goes through collections one-by-one) → Iterator, ListIterator

4. How to Choose the Right Collection?
   Need Best Collection
   Store items with duplicates & order matters ArrayList or LinkedList
   No duplicates allowed HashSet or TreeSet
   Key-Value storage HashMap or TreeMap
   Queue (FIFO behavior) ArrayDeque or PriorityQueue
5. What to Avoid? (Old Implementations)

   🚫 Vector → Use ArrayList instead.

   🚫 Stack → Use ArrayDeque.

   🚫 Hashtable → Use HashMap.

6. Key Benefits of Collections
   <b>
   ✔️ Easier to Use – Pre-built operations (add, remove, search, etc.).
   ✔️ More Powerful – Works better in large applications.
   ✔️ Optimized for Performance – Uses efficient memory and processing.
